#### If you have unsafe-eval with @babel/runtime

If you have CSP problems with `unsafe-eval` by using @babel/runtime. You can configure this as follows:

1. Extends the `webpack.config.js` like this<br>

```js
module.exports = (...args) => {
  // Here using the example for react
  const config = require('@leanup/stack-react/webpack.config')(...args);

  config.module.rules.unshift({
    test: /runtime.js$/,
    loader: 'string-replace-loader',
    options: {
      search: /[^\w]Function\(/,
      replace: '// Function(',
    },
  });

  return config;
};
```

#### If you need the frame material

If you need the frame material from the public folder in your dist folder. You can configure this as follows:

1. Install `npm i -D copy-webpack-plugin`
2. Extends the `webpack.config.js` like this<br>

```js
module.exports = (...args) => {
  // Here using the example for react
  const config = require('@leanup/stack-react/webpack.config')(...args);

  const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');
  if (args[0].WEBPACK_BUILD) {
    config.plugins.push(
      new CopyPlugin({
        patterns: [
          {
            from: 'public',
          },
        ],
      })
    );
  }

  return config;
};
```
